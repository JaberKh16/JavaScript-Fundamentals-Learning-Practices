    JavaScript Web APIs Concept
    ===========================
    Before understanding Web APIs, first discuss what API is?- API
    stands for Application Programming Interface which holds some
    functionality to do some specific sort of works while being
    request.

    API is basically a software intermediary that allows two applications 
    to talk to each other. 
    For Example- Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant 
    message, or check the weather on your phone. 
    How? - Through using an API.

    Now, An Web API is an API for the Web Only.

    Advantage of Web API
    --------------------
    1) can extends the functionality of a Browser.
    2) can greatly simplify the complex functions.
    3) can provide easy syntax to complex code.
    
    There are two types of Web API for Browser-
        1) Browser APIs
        2) Third Party APIs

    Browser APIs
    ------------
    All browsers have a set of built-in Web APIs to support complex operations, 
    and to help accessing data.
    
    For Example- Geolocation API can return the coordinates of where the 
    browser is located.


    Third Party APIs
    ----------------
    Third party APIs are not built into your browser. To use these APIs, 
    will have to download the code from the Web.

    For Examples:

    a) YouTube API - Allows you to display videos on a web site.
    b) Twitter API - Allows you to display Tweets on a web site.
    c) Facebook API - Allows you to display Facebook info on a web site.
