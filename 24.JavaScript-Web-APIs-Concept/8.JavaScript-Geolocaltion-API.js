/*
    JavaScript Geolocation API
    ==========================
    Geolocation API is used to get the geographical position of a host's
    machine.

    Since this can comprise privacy, the position is not available unless
    the user approves it.

    Note: As of Chrome 50, the Geolocation API will only work on secure context
    such as HTTPs.

    Geolocation API Object Methods
    ------------------------------
    1) getCurrentPosition() --> returns the host's location(in latitude and longitude).
                                if the getCurrentPosition() method is successful, 
                                then it returns a coordinates object to the function 
                                specified in the parameter (showPosition)
