The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the 
objects that orbit it. It formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational
collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. The vast majority of the 
system's mass is in the Sun, with most of the remaining mass contained in 
the planet Jupiter.
