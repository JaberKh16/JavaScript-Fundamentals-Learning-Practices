DOM Concept In JS
=================
DOM stands for Document Object Model which is used to manipulate document with JS. It is
basically used to manipulate HTML and CSS elements dynamically of the web page to make the
page more dynamic and interactive.

DOM is a cross-platform and language independent model for representing and interacting with elements
in HTML documents.

DOM is neither a part of HTML nor a part of JavaScript instead a set of rules and can't acccess without having a document.

Nodes Concept
=============
DOM is a collection of nodes. Everyting in HTML document is a node.

Types of nodes
--------------
there are two types of nodes basically can be found in HTML document in an upper point of view which are-
	
	1) Parent Node
	2) Child Node 

When we are talking about nodes then there's need to be consider three main things which are the following,
	
	1) Element Nodes
	2) Text Nodes
	3) Attribute Nodes

Now see the below example-
	
	<p class = 'paragragh'> this is a text content </p>

Here, "<p> </p>" itself is a Element Node, 'class' is Attribute Node and inside the p tag whatever 
content is written consider as a Text Node.
 


DOM Based Methods
=================
1) document.getElementById('id_value');  // used to get the element through 'id'
2) document.getElementByClassName('class_value'); // used to get the element through class name
3) document.getElementByTagName('tag_name'); // used to get the element through tag name
4) document.querySelectorsAll('property- class/id/attribute'); // used get the query selector
5) document.write('anystring'); // used to write directly to the browser, not encourage to use though with page load overrides everything
6) document.innerText = "anystring"; // used to change the inner text of any element
7) doucment.innerHTML = "anystring"; // used to change the HTML content of an element
8) document.getElementById().propertyName; // used to change the CSS property value of HTML attribute.
9) document.getElementById().addEventListener("eventName", functionName); // used to perform action based on event name provided.
