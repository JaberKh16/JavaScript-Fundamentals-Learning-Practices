/*
    Jquery Events and Event Hanlders Concept
    ========================================
    Jquery provides some simple methods to work with events basically those methods attaches
    the event handlers(nothing but the function) to do particular task. Those handlers are 
    being called upon when the selector for that handler being triggered. Insied this
    handlers 'this' refers to the DOM element that initiated the event. This methods
    are also called 'Jquery Helper Functions'.

    Jquery event methods trigger or attach a function to an event handler for the selected
    element. Jquery simply provides a method named - on() to respond to any event on any
    selected elements which is called "Event Binding".

    Event Binding Or Unbinding
    --------------------------
    Jquery other function like- bind() to attach an event handler to the selected element
    whereas unbind() function is used to detattach an event handler of that selected 
    element. In later, Jquery version these two methods are being replaced with
    on() and off() methods respectively.
