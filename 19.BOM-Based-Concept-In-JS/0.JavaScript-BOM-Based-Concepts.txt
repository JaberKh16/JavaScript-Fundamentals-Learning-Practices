JavaScript BOM Based Concepts

methods and properties which can be listed like the following-
    
    a) global variables --> "window" object properties

JavaScript Popup Boxes

are the following-

    1) window.alert()
    2) window.confirm()
    3) window.prompt()

JavaScript Timing Events
------------------------
Timing Events are also part of BOM "window" object. There are 4 types of timing events
which are the following-
    
    1) setTimeout(callback, timer)
    2) setInterval(callback, timer)
    3) clearTimeout(timervariable)
    4) clearInterval(timervariable)

JavaScript Cookies
------------------
JavaScript Cookies are nothing but the meta information about the client informations
saved in web browser.
Cookies basically are the data stored in small text files on client's computer.
Advantage Of Cookies
---------------------
When a web server has sent a web page to browser because of client request to particular
web page, after serving the request server generally close the connection thus the server
forgests everything about the client. Thus 'Cookies' comes into play to set some information
about the client so that when that client again visits that web page, server gets that client
user information from the 'Cookie' and that client doesnot have to go through again the
client-server request/response process thus saves a lot of delaying.
Cookies Syntax
--------------
1) document.cookie = "cookie_name = value";
2) document.cookie = "cookie_name = value; expires= ; path=/";
