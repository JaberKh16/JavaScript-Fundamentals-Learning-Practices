/*
    JavaScript BOM Based Object - TimingEvents Object
    =================================================
    TimingEvents is one of the BOM tools to work with the timing related events.
    BOM has 4 types of timing events which are the following-
        
        1) setTimeout(callback, timer)      ---> to set a timer for a function to call for once.
        2) setInterval(callback, timer)     ---> to set a timer for a function to call repeatedly.
        3) clearTimeout(timervariable)      ---> to clear the setTimout().
        4) clearInterval(timervariable)     ---> to clear the setInterval().
